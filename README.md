# 🚀 AI POWERED JOB RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 

## 🌟 OVERVIEW

Finding the right job can be overwhelming, with endless searches across multiple job platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor. This AI-powered Job Recommendation System simplifies the process by scraping job listings, analyzing your profile, and presenting the most relevant opportunities—all in one place.

This system integrates a .NET backend with a Python-based AI model to deliver highly relevant job recommendations. The AI model parses resumes, extracts key skills, and matches job descriptions using advanced NLP techniques.

## 🔑 KEY FEATURES

### 🏆 USER PROFILE MANAGEMENT

Create and manage profiles, including job preferences (title, location, and skills) for better recommendations.

Store parsed skills from uploaded resumes for enhanced job matching.

## 📄 RESUME PARSING

Upload your resume, and let the AI extract key skills and experience.

Automatically integrates extracted information into the user profile.

## 🎯 TAILORED JOB RECOMMENDATIONS

Scrapes job listings from Indeed and other platforms using Selenium & Beautiful Soup.

Uses TF-IDF vectorization & cosine similarity to analyze job descriptions and match them with user profiles.

Assigns a relevance score and recommends jobs above a predefined threshold.

## ⏳ REAL-TIME JOB SCRAPING & UPDATES

Continuously scrapes and updates job postings to ensure fresh recommendations.

Stores job listings efficiently in SQL Server.

## 🏗 ASYNCHRONOUS MODEL TRAINING

Uses Celery & Redis to enable background training without performance impact.

Applies linear regression to improve job relevance scoring dynamically.

## 📦 FULLY CONTAINERIZED DEPLOYMENT

Dockerized services for seamless scalability and deployment.

Separate containers for Flask API, Job Scraper, Redis, and Relevance Calculator.

## 🛠 TECH STACK

🔹 BACKEND

.NET Core (C#) for main application logic.

Flask API (Python) for AI-based recommendation engine.

SQL Server for structured job and user data storage.

JWT Authentication for secure user sessions.

## 🔹 AI & MACHINE LEARNING
